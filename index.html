    <h1>About Me - My Web Development Journey</h1>
    <img src="media/images/coding.png" alt="Web Development Journey">
    <h3  class="mt">Introduction</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Joe, and my journey into web development started in a fun and unexpected wayâ€”customizing my MySpace profile! What began as a simple interest in making my page stand out soon turned into a passion for coding and building technology.</p>
    <h3  class="mt">How It All Started</h3>
    <p>My first hands-on experience with web development was editing my MySpace profile. I enjoyed learning bits of HTML to add personality to my page. However, I didnâ€™t fully dive into programming until I took a Java course in college. From there, my curiosity grew, and I began exploring different programming languages and web technologies.</p>
    <h3  class="mt">What I Love About Web Development</h3>
    <p>I enjoy the process of building, problem-solving, and seeing a project take shape before my eyes. Whether it's developing a mobile app or designing a website, I find excitement in bringing ideas to life through code.</p>
    <h3  class="mt">Key Milestones</h3>
    <p>Some of the biggest highlights of my journey so far include:</p>
    <ul class="lists">
      <li><p>Taking and completing several college courses in various programming languages.</p></li>
      <li><p>Working through tutorials and online courses to refine my skills.</p></li>
      <li><p>Successfully building my own websites and mobile applications.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3  class="mt">Future Goals</h3>
    <p>I am committed to staying engaged with the latest web technologies. My goals include:</p>
    <ul class="lists">
      <li><p>Keeping my skills up to date with industry trends.</p></li>
      <li><p>Landing a role as a web or mobile developer.</p></li>
      <li><p>Exploring freelance opportunities to build diverse projects.</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3  class="mt">Interests & Motivation</h3>
    <p>Beyond web development, I have experience in mobile app development, both native (iOS) and hybrid (React Native/Flutter). My hobbies, such as gaming and sports, have inspired me to create projects related to these interests. I also have an interest in game development and have worked on 2D games.  I'm excited about the possibilities that web development offers and look forward to growing as a developer while contributing to creative and impactful projects!</p>
    <h3  class="mt">Thank You for Visiting!</h3>
